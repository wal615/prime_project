# Hemoglobin hypothesis

The Hemoglobin hypothesis is __Are POPs associated with hemoglobin A1c in non-diabetics__. More details could be found in the Grant folder in BOX drive. 

## Dataset 

1. [nhance_hemoglobin.sas7bdat](./nhance_hemoglobin.sas7bdat) is the original subset based Hemoglobin hypothesis.
1. [nhance_hemoglobin_PCB.csv](./nhance_hemoglobin_PCB.csv) is a column subset based on the original data. The columns selected are PCBs and LBXGH (the response). 
1. [nhance_hemoglobin_PCB_LC_comp.csv](./nhance_hemoglobin_PCB_LC_comp.csv) is a cleaned dataset based on the original subset. The specific procedure are following:
    - Remove all observations if the response is missing
    - Remove all observations if all the PCBs and PCB_LC (below limit of detection (LOD)) are missing 
    - Replace all the $\sqrt{\text{LOD}}$ with LOD (for data imputation)
